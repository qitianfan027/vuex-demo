## How to run

First, clone the repo and run `npm install`. To update the cryptocurrency price data, run `npm run data-update`. Next choose which step to run. Each folder that starts with "src-" is a step. For example "src-init" is the "init" step. To start the server with the init step, run `STEP=init npm run serve`, and it will start a server on `localhost:8080`.
